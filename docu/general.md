## Testing

Jest is used for testing. The tests are located in the `__tests__` directory.
It can be run easily from the command line using `npm run test`. This will run all tests, and is helpful for CI/CD pipelines.

Additionally, test coverage can be generated using `npm run test:coverage`. This will generate a coverage report in the command line as well as in the `coverage` directory.
